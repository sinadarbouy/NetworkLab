Connect timing results for 100 successful connections
  - min time: 0.679000 ms
  - max time: 1028.305300 ms
  - average time: 771.562654 ms
 (0 connections failed!)
Roundtrip timing results for 1 connections for 10000 round trips
  - min time: 147990.858000 ms
  - max time: 147990.858000 ms
  - average time: 147990.858000 ms
```
the average time for 100 successful connections is 25% less than previouse lab.

# Exercise I.a.3
Is it still possible to block the server using a single client? (Try it!)
the server may block for a long time (perhaps forever) waiting for the entire message to be received from the client; during that time, the server will not be able to respond to other clients. 
# Exercise I.a.4
yes, if we clone one of the connection the other connection is going to be close to.
